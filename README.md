## üß† NeuroCalm

**NeuroCalm** is an innovative neurotechnology solution built to enhance **mental well-being** and **boost productivity** through real-time brain analysis and intelligent neural modulation.

### üîó Core Components

#### 1. **NeuroLence (Model 1) ‚Äì Brainwave Analysis**
- Analyzes real-time **EEG signals** (brainwave data).
- Utilizes **machine learning algorithms** to detect:
  - Stress levels  
  - Cognitive states (e.g., focus, relaxation)
  - Neural activity patterns
- Provides deep insights into brain function with zero manual intervention.

#### 2. **NeuroBeam (Model 2) ‚Äì Neural Modulation**
- Integrates a **Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS)** system.
- Transmits **controlled electrical impulses** to targeted brain regions.
- Activated only when stress is detected, aiming to:
  - Calm the mind  
  - Improve concentration  
  - Restore mental balance

### ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works
1. **NeuroLence** detects high stress or mental imbalance from EEG data.
2. Upon detection, a **"Release Distress Signal"** action is triggered.
3. **NeuroBeam** sends neural feedback via DBS to soothe and regulate brain activity.

### üí° Key Features
- Real-time monitoring and response system.
- Fuses **AI**, **neuroscience**, and **biofeedback**.
- Non-invasive and adaptable to diverse environments.
- Ideal for stress management in **workspaces**, **learning environments**, and **clinical settings**.
